This tool was developed to analyze preprocessed data specifically for VAST Mini challenge2 (http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast10/index.php/taskdesc/index) in Summer 2010.

The tool is an open source tool built in Java. It gives values of various factors using filters of city and syndromes on the data set. It shows plots of the processed data also.

These graphs are drawn using open source graph plotting software â€“ GNUplot (http://www.gnuplot.info/). The tool analyzes the preprocessed data in variety of ways.
